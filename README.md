		Exploring Kotlin, Flutter, and Android Studio During a Semester Abroad

During my study abroad in Sweden, I embarked on a project that combined two passions of mine: software development and animal welfare. The result was a Kotlin-based mobile application inspired by techniques employed by modern dating apps; but instead designed for pet adoption. This merging of features allowed users to match with adoptable pets in their area using a refined matchmaking algorithm. Now, the app has a well thought out matchmaking algorithm, location services implementation, personability, and above all, a smooth user experience.

While the concept was exciting, potentially helping animals find homes, the execution was pretty challenging. Built using Firebase Firestore, the algorithm gets all the pet listings from each shelter and evaluates them against user preferences through what is known as a “soft scoring” mechanism. Unlike hard filters that exclude many potential matches, I implemented a more flexible point-based system to allow for a greater number of matches and broader discoverability for these animals and shelters. Qualities such as species, size, activity level, and age each has certain weighted points that contributed to a compatibility score. In addition, bonus points were given for behavioral compatibility, especially if the pet is good with children and other animals. A selected trait matching menu further increased the score based on overlap with a list of user-chosen qualities. Each pet is then assigned a compatibility score (compatibilityScore) and sorted in descending order to deliver the best matches first.

From a data standpoint, this involved data fetching across multiple subcollections (shelters through pets in my case), merging parent data such as shelter name and contact info into each singular pet profile. This structure allowed for a better user experience on the front end while also helping maintain a relatively standardized database. I also implemented several null-safe operations and catches to ensure that missing data wouldn’t break the algorithm, or worse, crash the app. After testing the limits of the software, I realized how critical this was when working to create a user friendly app using Firestore.

The matchmaking page displays pets ranked via the aforementioned compatibilityScore, which is shown as a percentage to help users easily identify their matches quickly. When a user taps a pet card, they are routed to a detailed profile via the PetDetailPage, with many of the most common animal adoption criteria right there on display for the user. All of the database operations are wrapped in error handling in order to manage issues such as failed updates or unauthenticated access; this feedback is delivered via the SnackBar. All of these ensure a smooth, real-time matchmaking experience tied directly to the user's Firebase data.

Integrating location services was another technical hurdle. I wanted the app to prioritize matches not just based on compatibility, but by how close they were too. Early versions struggled to correctly rank nearby pets, and some matches didn’t update after the user had moved. I initially tried to build a mapping widget using raw location data and distance formulas (truly using those engineering skills in me), but the complexity and inconsistency in my testing made it difficult, and unreliable. After several frustrating days of trying to get it to work, I eventually outsourced the location handling to Google Maps. By integrating it such that users can see how far it is at the tap of a button, I ensured that users wouldn't be left confused or waiting for my previous implementation to run its calculations. Results now load quickly and as expected, significantly improving the user experience while offloading sensitive data to a trusted, scalable software.

More technically, in order to simplify location handling, I used the url_launcher package to open Google Maps using the shelter names as search queries (pet['shelterName']), eliminating the need for physical coordinates. The _openShelterLocation() method creates a geo URI in order to launch the Google Maps app directly. I also implemented a fall back to a browser-based URL in case the app ever becomes unavailable. This two pronged approach, improves platform compatibility whilst still maintaining user experience. Failures are gracefully handled using the SnackBar and the design reduces mapping complexity as well as geocoding limitations.

Despite the progress I was making with the app itself, version control was a persistent nightmare when I originally was working on this project. Working with GitHub felt like an uphill battle that never truly got any easier. I constantly struggled with pushing and pulling updates, merge conflicts appearing out of nowhere, and attempting to resolve them using the side-by-side comparison tools often resulted in more broken code and frustration than progress. From time to time I’d finally get a merge to work, only to see that it overwrote code I needed or just completely broke the project. Eventually, I stopped trusting the remote repository all together, keeping updates local out of fear of breaking something that was already working. This disconnect made it harder to maintain momentum with the group and made getting feedback nearly impossible, especially as the project grew in complexity.

In all honesty, after returning to the U.S., I found it increasingly difficult to devote time to the project. Between full-time university, starting a full-time job, and taking a rigorous summer course, my schedule grew to nearly 14 hours of daily commitments, excluding homework, and not counting my 2.5 hour commute. Despite my continued want to get work done on the app, time became my biggest barrier. Still, I’ve kept the project alive ultimately reaching the point that I have today

Looking back, this Flutter pet adoption app was more than just a coding project, it was a test of my problem solving abilities and my will-power to overcome difficulties and struggles.  Whilst I certainly struggled and it pushed my technical skills to their limits, I am ultimately satisfied with the outcome. I feel as if I have deepened my understanding of mobile app development, as well as with the social implications of humane tech. I hope to return to it with full force when life lightens up. Until then, it remains a beacon of my potential, and a fond memory of my Study Abroad experience.
